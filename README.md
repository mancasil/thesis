# Python Simulation

A simple python simulation. The basic code in which 
extensive experiments were based in order to evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework in the thesis.

The subject of the thesis was to find an efficient way to distribute Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) users to the available
MEC servers and additionally determine the percentage of the data they would offload, based on their personal 
time and energy constraints. A game theoretic approach was adopted, in which users acting as learning
automata aim to maximize their overall utility or satisfaction.
